# Rate-My-Friends

I have 3 sets of friends I want to briefly discuss about each one of them. I would love to rate them on scale of 1 to 100. 2 primary tools in Python I've used which are Radio Buttons along with creating a small scale (by 20's). Each of my friends have their own button when clicked on, displays brief true fact about them. I've also created a scale by which you direct up and down between 1 to 100. When you stop at a given integer, their is small submit button at the button which displays how my 3 friends together are rated
