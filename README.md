# Rate-different-individuals

I have 3 sets of individuals that I would like to briefly discuss about each one of them. I would love to rate them on scale of 1 to 100. 2 primary tools in Python I've used which are Radio Buttons along with creating a small scale (by 20's). Each of these individuals has their own button. When you select a button from an individual, it displays brief displays true facts about them. I've also created a scale by which you may direct up and down between 1 to 100. When you stop at a given integer, there is a small submit button at the button which displays how the three individuals are rated equally.
